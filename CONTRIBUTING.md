## Pull Requests

**We welcome contributions in the form of pull requests!**

To make the review process smoother, please follow these guidelines:

* **Fork the repository:** Create a fork of the project to work on your changes.

As you're working on bug-fixes or features, please break them out into their own feature branches and open the pull request against your feature branch. It makes it much easier to decipher down the road, as you open multiple pull requests over time, and makes it much easier for us to approve pull requests quickly.

**We'll review your pull request as soon as possible and provide feedback.**
